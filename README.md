# Topic-Sensitive-Seed-Selection :

# Basic-Thoughts

We have proposed a new approach of  seed selection for topic aware influence maximization. We proposed a Coordination model, in which every potential influencer of seed node makes its decision based on the benefit of coordination with its neighbours in the network to maximize the information propagation.Multiple attributes related to individual nodes action log and node to node interaction are analysed to provide data driven seed set generation.Here,maximum spread is done considering the time spent by each person on that post .We are conducting experiments to validate the performance of our approach.The work is submitted in a conference for consideration.
